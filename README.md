The RS485 shield
================

The RS485Shield is a shield for Arduino or Netduino boards. It lets you easily create a simple RS485 node station able to read and write on a standard RS485 bus. The shield is equipped with a set of jumpers used to
enable/disable RS485 bus termination and/or balance. There are useful
screw-type connectors to attach pushbuttons and/or analog signals. 
Digital signals could be pulled-up and/or down through onboard dip switches.
